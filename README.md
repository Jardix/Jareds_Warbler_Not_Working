# Jareds_Warbler_Now_Working
Not working; stuck on displaying filtered Warbles

As of 11-11-21 10:50 AM (US PDT Time), this was not working. I am circling around using a .filter method, but it isn't quite working. 
Line 339 of app.py is where the troble starts. 

Update: 11-13-21 
This is now working, after comparing notes with the solution's app.py. It turns out, my filter was insanely close, it was just missing a dictionary (I think, whatever [] is python. I prefer simple arrays...) that was built out of the users the current user was following. Once that was implemented, the rest of the code was cleaned up and organized, with ample comments added.

Any work that I myself did on the base code is marked with a 'Jareds Implementation', for easy control-f searching.
